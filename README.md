# Noter
A little repo to chronicle my casual expedition toward a better, nay, the BEST note-taking app. No, I haven't heard of APP_THAT_EXISTS, and nope, I don't want to sign up to PRE-EXISTING_SERVICE. For this bad boy, we're building from the ground up - and you ain't gonna stop me.

## Dev log ~
1. First things first, I'll be following [this][1] guide for establishing an MVP.

2. Following that, I want to format my textarea with markdown, so will use [marked][2] for that.

3. Of course, textarea can't be formatted. Because i'm impatient and want to see something cool **now**, I'll be using the *contenteditable* attribute. I found [this][3] to be a great read though, and very eye-opening, so I'll be looking at creating a custom editor in the future.
