# Noter
> A little repo to chronicle my casual expedition toward my own [WYSISWYG](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=WYSIWYG) rich-text editor. No, I don't care about APP_THAT_EXISTS, and nope, I don't want to sign up to PRE-EXISTING_SERVICE. For this bad boy, we're building from the ground up - and you ain't gonna stop me.

#### TL;DR: [Live Demo](https://supernaturalcow.github.io/Noter/)!

## Dev log ~
1. First things first, I'll be following [this](http://eqdn.tech/html5-note-app-tutorial/) guide for slapping together a rough MVP.
2. Following that, I want to format my textarea with markdown, so will use [marked](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) for that.
3. Of course, textarea can't be formatted. Because I'm impatient and want to see something cool **now**, I'll be using the _contentEditable_ attribute. I found [this cautionary-tale on contentEditable](https://medium.com/content-uneditable/contenteditable-the-good-the-bad-and-the-ugly-261a38555e9c) to be a great read though, and very eye-opening, so I'll be looking at creating a custom editor in the future.
3. At this point, I've got a nice little textbox, a scrollbar, and a few buttons for converting markdown to HTML. The raw markdown text gets saved before converting, to allow us to revert back. Currently, you have to be in markdown-mode in order to add content, and HTML-mode is only for viewing it as a pretty output. This is the biggest gripe I have with current Markdown to HTML editors. I want my Markdown to turn to HTML the second I write it, only turning back to Markdown when I copy text to the clipboard, or save it to file. 
4. Marked is great and all, but it doesn't let you convert _back_ to Markdown from HTML. On another [review of the market of markdown converters](https://lmgtfy.com/?q=markdown+converter+javascript+github) (__there's a lot__), I decided to give [Showdown](https://github.com/showdownjs/showdown) a crack. The 'makeMarkdown' routine is experimental, and the code for it is __hectic confusing__, but it works, so who am I to complain. ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯ I am having significant trouble with leading '\\'s, though, so may need to pay their GitHub issues section a visit.
5. Turns out Markdown and HTML don't work together as nicely as I'd hoped. I've resorted to using a __<.pre>__ for Markdown, and a __<.div>__ for HTML, and have taken control over the text input. This should prevent unwanted __<.br>__s and __<.div>__s from popping up. I also stripped all the debugging tools out, so now we're left with what is a fairly usable, if not redundant, Markdown to HTML to Markdown converter. I just need to fix those pesky leading slashes, and somehow stop the Markdown converter from inserting ___<\!\-- HTML comment fragments -->___ into the text.
